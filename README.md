# My Notes by lucaohost

## Proposal
- Document notes about my learnings and experiences;
- Share knowledge with the community;
- Make it easier for me to write, find, and review notes;
- Bit by bit, I'll translate and add old notes that I have kept in my Google Docs since September 2017.

# Ubuntu
- Issue with session keyring on Ubuntu using biometrics
  - Without using a password, I used biometrics, and then it asked for a password to unlock the session keyring, which is annoying.
  - One solution is not to shut down the computer, so I only need to enter the password the first time I boot up.
  - When locking the screen again, it can be unlocked with biometrics, and it wonâ€™t ask for the session keyring again.
  - From time to time, it is recommended to shut down the computer. I feel it starts getting a bit slow sometimes, maybe due to too much data in the cache and RAM.
