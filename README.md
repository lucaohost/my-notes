# My Notes by lucaohost

## Proposal
- Document notes about my learnings and experiences;
- Share knowledge with the community;
- Make it easier for me to write, find, and review notes;
- Bit by bit, I'll translate and add old notes that I have kept in my Google Docs since September 2017.

## Ubuntu
- Issue with session keyring on Ubuntu using biometrics
  - Without using a password, I used biometrics, and then it asked for a password to unlock the session keyring, which is annoying.
  - One solution is not to shut down the computer, so I only need to enter the password the first time I boot up.
  - When locking the screen again, it can be unlocked with biometrics, and it wonâ€™t ask for the session keyring again.
  - From time to time, it is recommended to shut down the computer. I feel it starts getting a bit slow sometimes, maybe due to too much data in the cache and RAM.

## DBeaver
- FATAL: too many connections for role "my.username"
  - It was opening a separate connection to fetch the metadata from the database, such as tables and columns.
  - And the server was configured to allow only 1 connection per user
  - To fix that it's necessary to unable open a second connection to download metadata. For me only worked if I changed in 2 places:
    - Right bottom connection > Edit Connection > Metadata > Open separate Connection to Download Metadata > Never
    - Menu > SWLEditor > Open separate Connection to download Metadata > Never
  - The DBeaver version was 23.34
  - Changing only in 1 place, it didn't work.

## Shell script
```shell
if [ -z "$my_variable" ];
  echo "My variable is empty"
  exit 1;
fi
```
- [ -z "$commit_info" ]: This is a test command that checks if the length of the string stored in commit_info is zero (i.e., if it is empty).
- -z: This flag checks if the string is of zero length.
- "$my_variable": This is the variable being checked. The double quotes around the variable ensure that it is treated as a single string, even if it contains spaces or is empty.
